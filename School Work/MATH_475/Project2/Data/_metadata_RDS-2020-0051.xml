    <descript>
      <abstract>The original public land survey for the Umatilla National Forest was completed primarily between 1879 and 1887. Notes from these General Land Office (GLO) surveys provide the earliest systematically recorded information about species composition for national forest system lands in the Blue Mountains of northeastern Oregon and southeastern Washington. Using these historical records we were able to obtain GLO survey point locations as well as tree species and size information for trees found in the survey process. Point locations are included as a shapefile, and trees species and diameter are provided in tabular format.</abstract>
      <purpose>The GLO survey notes serve as a data source for characterizing presettlement vegetation conditions for the Umatilla National Forest.</purpose>

It was found that paper printouts from microfiche records could be hard to read. Printing out a hard copy of the GLO database and checking it for inconsistencies and errors, while paying particular attention that the correct legal description was matched to the correct ID number, required several days for a large analysis area such as the Umatilla National Forest.</attraccr>

        <methdesc>BACKGROUND - PUBLIC LAND SURVEY
		
Public land surveys followed a consistent and standardized process when it was used to subdivide lands in western United States. First, an initial starting point was selected. For Oregon and Washington, this starting point is located a short distance west of the city of Portland, Oregon. From this starting point north-south and east-west survey lines were generated. This process of establishing township and range lines resulted in land and water areas being divided into grid cells measuring 6 × 6 miles (36 square miles per cell). Area within each individual six-mile-on-a-side cell is called a township. (See Powell 2008 for more details.)
		
Tree species and diameter (ostensibly as a diameter at breast height), along with distance and direction to a corner, were provided for up to four bearing trees at each survey line (section) corner and quarter corner (halfway along section; see figure 1 in Powell 2008). If bearing trees were not available, surveyors selected a non-tree reference monument.

In addition to bearing-tree information, surveyors recorded common names and diameters of line trees used to mark a section line between section corners (but no distances from the line were recorded for these trees).


OBTAINING DATA FROM HISTORICAL FILES

All of the data included in this publication were obtained from historical records. Paper copies of the microfiche files for all townships within the Umatilla National Forest boundary were made using the office’s microfiche reader and copier. Processing the microfiche copies of the survey notes and plotting out the GIS maps required between one and two months' time. Reading and interpreting the survey notes required over 100, 8-hour workdays for approximately 120 townships. The notes for some townships were relatively easy to process and took, on average, a day to finish; others took longer. Some notes were typed up while others were handwritten.</methdesc>

FID = internal feature number, which contains sequential unique whole numbers that are automatically generated
Shape = feature geometry (point)
IDTRSD = join field of township, range, and section number


\Data\corner_trees.dbf and \Data\corner_trees.csv: dBase database file (DBF) and comma-delimited ASCII text file (CSV) containing tree species, diameter, and distance to survey points at section corners and quarter corners (i.e., middle of section lines). See Powell (2008) for more details.
Variables include:
OID = internal feature number
IDTRSD = join field of township, range, and section number
